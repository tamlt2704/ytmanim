## The Task

It's your first week as an intern at a fintech startup. The team processes payments, sends notifications, generates reports — all as background jobs. Right now they're using a tangled mess of cron scripts and manual queue management.

Your tech lead, Linus — yes, everyone calls him that, and yes, he reviews every PR like it's a kernel patch — walks over to your desk. "We need a proper job engine. Something that accepts jobs and runs them. Start simple — we'll iterate. Think you can handle it?"

You nod. How hard can it be?

You grab a coffee, open your laptop, and start typing.

## Initialize the Project

```bash
mkdir job-engine && cd job-engine
```

Create `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.3.5'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.6'
}

group = 'com.jobengine'
version = '1.0.0'

java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)
    }
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'

    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher'
}

tasks.named('test') {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

And `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
rootProject.name = 'job-engine'
```

Generate the Gradle wrapper so anyone can build without installing Gradle globally:

```bash
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.5
```

This creates `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, and the `gradle/wrapper/` directory. From here on, use `./gradlew` instead of `gradle`.

Spring Boot is just the container — the engine itself is pure Java. You wire up the main class and move on to the real work.

```java
// src/main/java/com/jobengine/JobEngineApplication.java
package com.jobengine;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class JobEngineApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(JobEngineApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Alright, scaffolding done. Time to build the thing Linus actually asked for.

## The Job Model

A job needs three things: an identity, a status, and a task to run. That's it. No priority, no timeout, no dependencies — Linus said start simple.

### Status

A job is either waiting to run, running, done, or broken.

```java
// src/main/java/com/jobengine/model/JobStatus.java
package com.jobengine.model;

public enum JobStatus {
    PENDING,
    RUNNING,
    COMPLETED,
    FAILED
}
```

Four states. We'll add more later when we need them.

### The Job

```java
// src/main/java/com/jobengine/model/Job.java
package com.jobengine.model;

import java.time.Instant;

public class Job {

    private final String id;
    private final String name;
    private final Runnable task;

    // ⚠️ BUG: plain field — no thread safety
    private JobStatus status = JobStatus.PENDING;
    private Instant startedAt;
    private Instant completedAt;
    private String failureReason;

    public Job(String id, String name, Runnable task) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.task = task;
    }

    // ⚠️ BUG: check-then-act is NOT atomic
    public boolean transitionTo(JobStatus expected, JobStatus next) {
        if (this.status == expected) {
            this.status = next;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getId() { return id; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public Runnable getTask() { return task; }
    public JobStatus getStatus() { return status; }
    public Instant getStartedAt() { return startedAt; }
    public Instant getCompletedAt() { return completedAt; }
    public String getFailureReason() { return failureReason; }

    public void setStartedAt(Instant t) { this.startedAt = t; }
    public void setCompletedAt(Instant t) { this.completedAt = t; }
    public void setFailureReason(String r) { this.failureReason = r; }
}
```

An id, a name, a `Runnable` task, and a status that transitions through the lifecycle. The `transitionTo()` method checks the current status before changing it — if the job is already RUNNING, a second call with `expected=PENDING` returns `false`.

This version has bugs. The `transitionTo()` check-then-act is not atomic, and the fields have no visibility guarantees across threads. We'll discover both in production and fix them in Chapters 2 and 3.

## The Job Engine

The engine takes a job and runs it. No threads, no queues. Just execute.

```java
// src/main/java/com/jobengine/engine/JobEngine.java
package com.jobengine.engine;

import com.jobengine.model.Job;
import com.jobengine.model.JobStatus;

import java.time.Instant;

public class JobEngine {

    /**
     * Execute a job synchronously. No threading — just run it.
     * We'll add queues, workers, and concurrency in later chapters.
     */
    public void execute(Job job) {
        if (!job.transitionTo(JobStatus.PENDING, JobStatus.RUNNING)) {
            return; // already running or done
        }

        job.setStartedAt(Instant.now());

        try {
            job.getTask().run();
            job.transitionTo(JobStatus.RUNNING, JobStatus.COMPLETED);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            job.transitionTo(JobStatus.RUNNING, JobStatus.FAILED);
            job.setFailureReason(e.getMessage());
        }

        job.setCompletedAt(Instant.now());
    }
}
```

Simple: transition to RUNNING, run the task, mark COMPLETED or FAILED.

## Verify It Compiles

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Green. Now let's make sure it actually works.

## Smoke Tests

Two tests. One job that succeeds, one that fails.

```java
// src/test/java/com/jobengine/engine/JobEngineSmokeTest.java
package com.jobengine.engine;

import com.jobengine.model.Job;
import com.jobengine.model.JobStatus;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

class JobEngineSmokeTest {

    @Test
    void shouldRunASingleJob() {
        JobEngine engine = new JobEngine();
        AtomicBoolean executed = new AtomicBoolean(false);

        Job job = new Job("1", "hello-world", () -> executed.set(true));

        engine.execute(job);

        assertThat(executed.get()).isTrue();
        assertThat(job.getStatus()).isEqualTo(JobStatus.COMPLETED);
        assertThat(job.getStartedAt()).isNotNull();
        assertThat(job.getCompletedAt()).isNotNull();
    }

    @Test
    void shouldHandleAFailingJob() {
        JobEngine engine = new JobEngine();

        Job job = new Job("2", "kaboom",
                () -> { throw new RuntimeException("Something broke"); });

        engine.execute(job);

        assertThat(job.getStatus()).isEqualTo(JobStatus.FAILED);
        assertThat(job.getFailureReason()).isEqualTo("Something broke");
    }
}
```

```bash
./gradlew test
```

All green. You lean back in your chair. That wasn't so bad.

![All tests passing](images/ch01-tests-green.svg)

You show Linus the green tests. He smiles. "Nice. Deploy it to staging."

You do. It works. For now.

But these tests only use one thread. The engine's `transitionTo()` check-then-act works perfectly when there's no contention. The bug only shows up when multiple threads call `execute()` on the same job at the same time — which is exactly what happens in production.
